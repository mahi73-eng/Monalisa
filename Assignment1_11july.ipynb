        "# python is popular because it has a clean and readable syntax. Even beginners can start writing useful code quickly.Python used for web development, data analysis,machine learning, automation game development. It is very versatile and multi-purpose.Python has powerful third party libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Flask."

It is also called translator in programming terminology.For example Python is an interpreted language because it executes line-by-line instructions. There are actually two way to execute python code one is in Interactive mode and another thing is having Python prompts which is also called script mode. Python does not convert high level code into low level code as many other programming languages do rather it will scan the entire code into something called bytecode."
